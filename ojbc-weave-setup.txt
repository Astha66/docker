# Abbreviated set of commands to get up and running with Docker for OJBC

# Step 1.  Install Docker Toolbox.  This is a manual process, described at:

	https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox

# Step 2.  Install Weave

curl -L git.io/weave -o /usr/local/bin/weave
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/weave

# Note: This install, like Docker Toolbox, only needs to be done once on your machine.  Of course, if they update either Weave
	or DT you'll want to update...

# Step 3.  Create OJB Docker Machine.

docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-cpu-count 2 --virtualbox-memory 4096 --virtualbox-hostonly-nicpromisc allow-all ojb-machine
eval $(docker-machine env ojb-machine)

If necessary, use this setting --virtualbox-no-vtx-check=true

# Note:  the eval command above has to be re-run in any new login shell you create.  So if you open a new terminal window, you have to re-execute it.

# Step 4.  Launch Weave proxy

weave launch --dns-domain=ojbc.local

# Note: weave may be launched to use a specific private ip address range by using this sample command parameter
# weave launch --dns-domain=ojbc.local --ipalloc-range 172.18.0.0/16
# http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/ipam.html#range

eval $(weave env)
weave expose

# Note:  the eval command above has to be re-run in any new login shell you create.  So if you open a new terminal window, you have to re-execute it.

# to check, run docker ps, and you should see weaveexec (weaveproxy) and weave containers running
# another check:  run weave status.

# Step 5.  Setup static routes

sudo route add -net 10.32.0.0/16 $(docker-machine ip ojb-machine)
sudo route add -net 172.17.0.0/16 $(docker-machine ip ojb-machine)

# Note:  this needs to be redone anytime you reboot your Mac

# Step 6.  Setup DNS

sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver/
sudo rm -f /etc/resolver/ojbc.local && echo "nameserver 172.17.0.1" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolver/ojbc.local

# Note:  The /etc/resolver/ojbc.local file will persist across reboots, but it's fine to run these commands whenever...
# Note:  If you are running OSX Yosemite you will need to run the following command:"sudo discoveryutil mdnsactivedirectory yes".  This is due to the way Yosemite handles .local domain names.

# Step 7.  Test

The easiest way is to pull the ojbc/java7-tomcat image from Docker Hub, run it, and then ping it and hit the Tomcat home page in your browser

docker run -d --name=tomcat ojbc/java7-tomcat

# Note: the name in DNS will be the same as the name of the container (i.e. the value of the --name= option).

# Check 1:  docker ps
	Should show the tomcat container running

# Check 2:  ping tomcat.ojbc.local
	Should ping

# Check 3:  Open http://tomcat.ojbc.local in a browser

	3a:  curl http://tomcat.ojbc.local # will give you a dump of that page in your shell
	3b:  Hit http://tomcat.ojbc.local in browser
