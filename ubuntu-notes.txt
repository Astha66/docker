#Notes for setting up Docker and Weave on Ubuntu

# Weave works slightly differently on Ubuntu compared to Mac OSX.  To setup weave, you follow steps 1, 2, and 4 from https://github.com/ojbc/docker/#blob/master/ojbc-weave-setup.txt  

# The difference is the way we “run” containers.  Instead of “docker run” we need to do “weave run”, for example:

weave run -d --name=analytics-db ojbc/analytics-d

############

#If you care, this is due to a difference in the way “DOCKER_HOST” is setup.  boot2docker (running in VirtualBox on the Mac) specifies DOCKER_HOST='-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376' whereas Ubuntu goes with the default which sets DOCKER_HOST to “unix:///var/run/weave/weave.sock”.  There is an option to specify DOCKER_HOST on Ubuntu in /etc/default/docker but there’s probably no sense messing with it.

#We’re still trying to figure out why weave proxy works differently between the two.  More to come.
